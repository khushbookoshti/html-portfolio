<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Khushboo Koshti. I am currently studying in the sixth semester of Software Engineering Technology program at Centennial College.
  I am enthusiastic, curious learner and a detail oriented person.

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen understanding of Java, Python, SQL, NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
  Throughout my course and educational projects, I have developed a responsive web app with authentication, admin dashboard, and data export using these technologies. 
  In SQL, I implemented CRUD operations, triggers, stored procedures, functions, and packages for user eligibility verification and administrative management which demonstrates my ability to create clean and scalable Back-End solutions</p>

<p>In addition to my technical expertise, what makes me unique is my capacity for productive teamwork.
